                      <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">Vaginal hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus through the vagina.<br>

                    During a vaginal hysterectomy, the surgeon detaches the uterus from the ovaries, fallopian tubes and upper vagina, as well as from the blood vessels and connective tissue that support it. The uterus is then removed through the vagina.<br><br>

                    Vaginal hysterectomy involves a shorter time in the hospital, lower cost and faster recovery than an abdominal hysterectomy, which requires an incision in your lower abdomen. However, if your uterus is enlarged, vaginal hysterectomy may not be possible and your doctor will talk to you about other surgical options, such as an abdominal hysterectomy.<br><br>

                    Hysterectomy often includes removal of the cervix as well as the uterus. When the surgeon also removes one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes, it's called a total hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy (sal-ping-go-o-of-uh-REK-tuh-me). All these organs are part of your reproductive system and are located in your pelvis.

                         Many hysterectomies are done to permanently treat fibroids — benign tumors in your uterus that can cause persistent bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain, pain during intercourse and bladder pressure.
                         <br>If you have large fibroids, you may need an abdominal hysterectomy — surgery that removes your uterus through an incision in your lower abdomen.</font>

                         Endometriosis occurs when the tissue lining your uterus (endometrium) grows outside of the uterus, involving the ovaries, fallopian tubes or other organs.
                          Most women with endometriosis have an abdominal hysterectomy, but sometimes a vaginal hysterectomy is possible.</font>

                          If you have cancer of the uterus, cervix, endometrium or ovaries, your doctor may recommend a hysterectomy to treat it.
                          Most of the time, an abdominal hysterectomy is done during treatment for ovarian cancer, but sometimes vaginal hysterectomy may be appropriate for women with cervical cancer or endometrial cancer.</font>

                         When pelvic supporting tissues and ligaments get stretched out or weak, the uterus can lower or sag into the vagina, causing urinary incontinence, pelvic pressure or difficulty with bowel movements. Removing the uterus with hysterectomy and repairing pelvic relaxation may relieve those symptoms.</font>

                        For most of these conditions — with the possible exception of cancer — hysterectomy is just one of several treatment options. You may not even need to consider hysterectomy if your doctor recommends hormonal medications or other less invasive gynecologic procedures that are successful in managing your symptoms.

                        You cannot become pregnant after you've had a hysterectomy. If you're less than completely sure that you're ready to give up your fertility, explore other treatments.</font></p>
