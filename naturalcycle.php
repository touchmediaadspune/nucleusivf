                      Natural Cycle IVF (also known as 'Natural IVF'), is IVF which is carried out within a natural menstrual cycle without the use of fertility drugs. Natural IVF aims to collect just the one egg that has been naturally selected and matured by the body. This type of treatment is more affordable and safer than other forms of IVF. By utilising natural selection it is hoped that a high quality egg will be collected and therefore a high quality embryo created.

                           We have pioneered a new approach with Natural Cycle IVF, where we combine a better understanding of ovarian physiology, our advances in ultrasound techniques and our medical and scientific expertise to deliver the optimum treatment.</font>

                           Many women are told that they cannot have a child with their own eggs because their AMH is too low, their FSH is too high, they have low ovarian reserve or that they are poor responders to fertility drugs. At CREATE, we are have an excellent track record in treating women in these circumstances with Natural IVF. We are able to tailor treatment with no or low amounts of stimulation drugs, thereby giving you the best chance to have a baby with your own eggs. We have successfully treated hundreds of women with critically low ovarian reserve/low AMH/high FSH. We have also had some of the oldest IVF mothers in the world who have had babies with their own eggs. We do not have any selection criteria and will allow any woman to try IVF  using their own eggs if they want to and are still ovulating (up to the age of 50).</font>

                            The egg which is naturally selected by the body can be of higher quality than those produced in a stimulated IVF cycle. In addition, high stimulation drugs can adversely impact the environment of the womb and the lining of the womb. By avoiding stimulating drugs, the womb is more receptive to pregnancy. There is also evidence that babies born with Natural Cycle IVF are more likely to be born at full term and with a healthier birth weight.</font>

                           The Natural IVF cycle involves the collection of a naturally produced egg without medication, with the fertilised embryo being placed back into a drug-free womb. Natural IVF is therefore the closest that IVF treatment can get to natural fertilisation. Natural IVF Treatment is carried out in your natural menstrual cycle, unlike conventional IVF where your ovaries are first suppressed. The potential side effects and complications are therefore reduced in Natural IVF.</font>

In addition, this in vitro fertilisation treatment offers a less invasive approach and the use of no/fewer drugs leads to fewer potential risks and side effects.</font>

It is particularly suitable for older women, those with low ovarian reserve or those that are poor responders to fertility drugs. It gives the opportunity for some women to have a child with their own eggs, rather than donor eggs.
                        It is also often chosen by those that want to avoid fertility drugs and associated risks and side-effects. Women who come to our clinics can choose to have Natural Cycle treatment as their first choice.</font></p>

                        <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">The first step is to come in for an initial scan and consultation. At this appointment the doctor will assess your situation and devise a personalised treatment plan. After this, you will come in 2 weeks before the start of your period to meet with a nurse. They will talk you through your treatment and go through the consent forms with you. You will then call up on the first day of your period (day 1) to book in your first scan. This will probably be on day 5, but could be earlier or later depending on the advice of the doctor. After the first scan, there will be around 2 or 3 more scans, usually performed every other day. The egg collection is generally performed on around day 12; this is carried out under sedation, and is followed by the embryo transfer a few days later.</font></p>

Multiple eggs are needed because some eggs won't fertilize or develop normally after fertilization. You may need several different medications, such as:</font></p>

                         To stimulate your ovaries, you might receive an injectable medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a luteinizing hormone (LH) or a combination of both. These medications stimulate more than one egg to develop at a time.</font>

If you're an older woman, or if you have had multiple failed IVF attempts, your doctor might recommend assisted hatching â€” a technique in which a hole is made in the zona pellucida just before transfer to help the embryo hatch and implant.</font>

Embryos that don't contain affected genes or chromosomes can be transferred to your uterus. While preimplantation genetic testing can reduce the likelihood that a parent will pass on a genetic problem, it can't eliminate the risk. Prenatal testing may still be recommended.</font>
