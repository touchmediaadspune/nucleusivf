                      <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">From the moment we hit adolescence we begin to learn about reproduction, and not just the how, but also the why. We are taught about the worth and sense of fulfillment that can come hand in hand with having a family, so naturally we grow up believing that when the time comes for us to create are own descendants (if of course we wish to), we will be able to do so.<br>

                    Infertility has been a source of sadness and despair since the earliest times, with stories of the emotional and social struggles of being unable to reproduce even appearing in the Old Testament.<br><br>

                   Feeling that your body is suddenly working against you can be a very painful realisation, and on top of this you may then also be expected to make extremely difficult decisions regarding your future. Should you try again? Or is it time to start thinking of other ways to start a family?<br><br>

                    So what is infertility? Infertility by definition, is a difficulty in conceiving despite having regular unprotected sex. There is no definitive cut off period after which a medical professional is able to say a couple is ‘infertile’, though statistics do suggest that the probability of a couple who have been trying to fall pregnant naturally for more than three years with no success is 25% or less.

                         The fallopian tubes are essentially the pathway from the ovary to the womb, along which the egg travels whilst being fertilised along the way. When the egg reaches the end of its journey down the fallopian tubes, it is then implanted into the lining of the womb where it then grows and matures into a baby.
                          However, if either the fallopian tubes or the womb are damaged, or indeed if they stop working, it may then become very difficult to conceive.</font>

                          The growth of this sticky tissue or cysts can lead to blockages and mishaping of the pelvis and can also distort the way in which the follicle releases the egg.</font>

                        <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">Yes, absolutely. If you have concerns about your fertility, talk to your partner – after all this is something which affects you both.
                        The thought that you may not be able to conceive may make it tempting to sneak off to visit your healthcare provider without another soul knowing, and whilst this is an understandable reaction it is always best to be open and honest about your concerns.
                        Tell your other half that you are worried and remember that fertility problems occur equally in men and women so both of you need to be there.<Br>

                        The realisation that there could in fact be an issue with conception can be an extremely emotional time, and certainly one in which both parties will need as much support from one another as possible.</font></p>

                        <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">For most couples ‘How long will it take to fall pregnant’ is one of the first questions they ask when they begin to actively start trying for a baby.
                        Unfortunately there is no set answer to that question, nor is there a definite line after which infertility is declared. Some couples are extremely lucky and find that they conceive after trying for just a short period of time. Others however will find that the process takes far longer, often so long that anxiety, frustration and fear that it may never happen all begin to set in.<Br>
                        Having concerns about falling pregnant is entirely natural, but at what point should these concerns be taken to a medical professional?

                        A couple should visit their GP if they have not conceived after one year of trying, although women over the age of 35, and anyone who is aware that they may have fertility problems (for example those seeking treatment for cancer) should seek help sooner. The GP can check for common causes of fertility problems and will also be able to suggest treatments and lifestyle changes that could help.</font></p>

                          As a patient it is your right to be referred to an NHS clinic for initial investigation, but be aware that waiting lists in some areas can be extremely long and thus the process may be very drawn out.<br>
                          You may wish to consider having private treatment although this can be expensive and there is no guarantee that it will be successful. It is, however, important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask your GP for advice, and you should make sure that you choose a clinic that is licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</font></p>

                        <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">Research has shown that infertility often has a stressful impact on relationships and can affect a couple’s sex life. The condition is isolating and can impact on how a couple communicate with each other and with the people around them. There can be a profound sense of loss and grief which can impact on closeness.<br>
                        Infertility can also carry with it a sense of denial with sadness and shock borne individually when pregnancy does not materialise. There can also be feelings of fear, guilt and abandonment from the partner who feels the problem lies with them. Women can feel less feminine and men can feel less masculine in the face of infertility.<br>
                        Infertility can also put stress on your relationship, with studies showing that couples dealing with infertility are more likely to feel unhappy with themselves and their marriages. It is important to express the feelings of sadness, loss and anger and to have good support from people around you who understand your position.<br>
                        As mentioned previously, many clinics offering Infertility Treatments also offer counselling or insist that a couple undertake professional counselling before embarking upon investigations and treatment. This can open up channels of communication and keep a couple in contact with each other as they undergo what can turn out to be challenging course of action.</font></p>
