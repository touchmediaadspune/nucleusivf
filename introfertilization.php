                      <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">In vitro fertilization (IVF) in Pune is a complex series of
                    procedures used to treat fertility or genetic problems and assist with the
                    conception of a child.<br>

                    During IVF, mature eggs are collected (retrieved) from your ovaries and
                    fertilized by sperm in a lab. Then the fertilized egg (embryo) or eggs are
                    implanted in your uterus. One cycle of IVF takes about two weeks.<br>

                    IVF is the most effective form of assisted reproductive technology. The
                    procedure can be done using your own eggs and your partner's sperm. Or IVF may
                    involve eggs, sperm or embryos from a known or anonymous donor. In some cases, a
                    gestational carrier — a woman who has an embryo implanted in her uterus — might
                    be used. <Br>


                    Your chances of having a healthy baby using IVF depend on many factors, such as
                    your age and the cause of infertility. In addition, IVF can be time-consuming,
                    expensive and invasive. If more than one embryo is implanted in your uterus, IVF
                    can result in a pregnancy with more than one fetus (multiple pregnancy).
                    <br>

                    Your doctor can help you understand how IVF works, the potential risks and
                    whether this method of treating infertility is right for you.</font>

                        <p class="mb-30"><font size="3"  color="black">In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a treatment in Pune for infertility or genetic problems. If IVF is performed to treat infertility, you and your partner might be able to try less invasive treatment options before attempting IVF, including fertility drugs to increase production of eggs or intrauterine insemination — a procedure in which sperm are placed directly in your uterus near the time of ovulation.<br>
                      Sometimes, IVF is offered as a primary treatment for
                    infertility in women over age 40. IVF can also be done if you have certain
                    health conditions. For example, IVF may be an option if you or your partner has:</font>

If you become pregnant, however, your symptoms might last several weeks.

                    When choosing an in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic in Pune, keep in mind that a clinic's success rate depends on many factors, such as patients' ages and medical issues, as well as the clinic's treatment population and treatment approaches. Ask for detailed information about the costs associated with each step of the procedure.<br><Br>

Since the rate of implantation is lower for older women, more embryos are usually transferred — except for women using donor eggs.<br><br>
                      Most doctors follow specific guidelines to prevent a higher order multiple pregnancy — triplets or more — and in some countries, legislation limits the number of embryos that can be transferred at once.

Not all embryos will survive the freezing and thawing process, although most will.<br>Cryopreservation can make future cycles of IVF less expensive and less invasive. However, the live birth rate from frozen embryos is slightly lower than the live birth rate from fresh embryos.

In some cases, fetal reduction can be used to help a woman deliver fewer babies with lower health risks. Pursuing fetal reduction, however, is a major decision with ethical, emotional and psychological consequences.</font>
